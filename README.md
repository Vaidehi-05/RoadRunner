## Getting Started ⚡

### Prerequisites 📌
✅ A C++ compatible compiler<br>
✅ Any OS : Windows/ Mac/ Linux<br>
<br>

### Build and Run 🚀

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RoadRunner.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd RoadRunner

# Compile
g++ CompleteCode.cpp -o RoadRunner

# Run
./RoadRunner

```

###  How it works 🛠️
1️⃣ Run RoadRunner and select your preferred roadmap specs.<br>
2️⃣ Enter your current skillset.<br>
3️⃣ All the topics are stored internally in a txt file, through which graphs are internally created through file parsing.<br>
4️⃣ Just add in your preferences.<br>
5️⃣ Enjoy real productivity with your custom roadmap!<br>

### File Structure 📖
💠FORMAT FOLLOWED:<br>
➡ Num_of_nodes:<br>
➡ Name:<br>
➡ ConnectedNodes:<br>
➡ EdgeStart:<br>
➡ EdgeEnd:<br>
